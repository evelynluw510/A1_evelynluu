        <p>My weekly screen time record shows how I share up my time across various apps. TikTok is at the top of the
          list, taking up over 18 hours of my week, followed by Messenger at 10. Instagram takes up three hours of my
          time, whereas Safari takes up eight hours, probably from surfing and research. Finally, at one hour, WhatsApp
          experiences the least amount of usage. It's interesting to see where my screen time is going, as I've spent 40
          hours on just five apps alone.

        <p>TikTok is by far the most used app, since I open it 130 times a week, according to my Average Pickups chart.
          This implies that anytime I unlock my phone, I have a strong habit of automatically checking TikTok.Safari
          comes in second with 96 pickups, suggesting that it is frequently used for web searches or browsing. With 43
          pickups, Messenger is probably used for communication, although significantly less frequently than TikTok or
          Safari. It's interesting to note that Instagram only receives 31 pickups. This could indicate that I use
          Instagram less regularly and for longer periods of time. With 73 picks, WhatsApp falls somewhere in the
          middle, showing consistent but occasional use.</p1>

    <p>Tracking my screen time over several weeks gives me important information about how my app usage changes. My
      usage decreased from 23 hours in the first week to 18 hours in the second, while TikTok is still the most
      popular app. This decline suggests that I might have consciously tried to spend less time scrolling. However,
      Messenger increased from 7 to 10 hours, suggesting that I might have been more active in messaging or chats
      during the second week. Instagram and WhatsApp usage did not vary, remaining at 3 and 1 hours, respectively,
      while Safari usage stayed steady at 8 hours.</p1>
  </div>
<br><br>
<p>Overall, the pattern shows that I've been using TikTok less, but I've been using communication applications more or less. I may have a better understanding of my digital habits and figure out whether I want to keep adjusting my screen time in order to achieve a better balance by going over these weekly revisions.</p1>
